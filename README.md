# **Resampling and Composite Processing for Himawari Satellite Data**  

## **Overview**  
This project processes **Himawari satellite imagery** using **SatPy** for tasks like resampling, cropping, aggregating, and generating composite images. It enables efficient analysis of meteorological satellite data by unifying resolutions, extracting key features, and visualizing RGB composites.

## **Features**  
- **Resampling**: Standardizes image resolution across multiple channels.  
- **Cropping**: Extracts specific regions for targeted analysis.  
- **Aggregation**: Merges data over time or space for improved clarity.  
- **RGB Composite Generation**: Enhances visualization of meteorological data.  
- **Automated Image Saving**: Saves processed images as PNG files for further use.  

## **Requirements**  
- Python  
- SatPy  
- Cartopy  
- Rasterio  
- Dask  

## **Usage**  
1. Mount Google Drive and install dependencies.  
2. Load Himawari satellite data using `SatPy`.  
3. Perform resampling, cropping, and aggregation.  
4. Generate RGB composite images.  
5. Save processed images for further analysis.
